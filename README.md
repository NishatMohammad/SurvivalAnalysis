# SurvivalAnalysis
Survival Analysis with CoxPH and Kaplan-Meier

## Overview
This project focuses on survival analysis using TCGA RNA-Seq expression data and corresponding clinical data files. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering techniques, Cox proportional hazards (coxph) analysis, and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis. 

## Key Components
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing TCGA RNA-Seq expression data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and summarizing key characteristics of the dataset.
- **Clustering**: Applying various clustering techniques to identify potential patient subgroups.
- **Cox Proportional Hazards (coxph) Analysis**: Assessing the impact of gene expression on survival outcomes.
- **Kaplan-Meier (KM) Survival Analysis**: Visualizing survival probabilities for different gene expression groups.

## Results and Insights
This analysis provides deeper insights into cancer survival, revealing potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The approach enables a comprehensive understanding of gene expression patterns and their impact on patient outcomes.
